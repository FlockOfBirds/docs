Any Chart building blocks are pre-configured widgets with the basic properties of a chart already defined. It contains the sample **data** and **Layout** objects required create a chart. These objects are used demo purposes at run time when there is no Source attribute selected or when rendering sample data in the web modeler preview.

#### Source attribute
